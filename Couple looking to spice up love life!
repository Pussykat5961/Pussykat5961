I'm not sure if I'm even looking in the right place but my man and I are looking to spice things up I

In our relationship with maybe adding another girl to the mix. But I am very self conscious and I am not as sure
 as he is. So I would rather find a woman that is more interested in me than my man because I can tend to be a jealous person. 
However I do enjoy men and women just usually in more of a one on one situation.  I know this will complicate things in my current relationship,
 but it seems to be something he has always wanted to try. Personally I have always fantasized about having my man and being able to have a sexy girlfriend on the side.
Anyways I am not sure if any of this will ever happen but I would love to see some feedback  any
Thoughts 💭.....??
